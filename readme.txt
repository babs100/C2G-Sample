This is a sample hack done by me to leverage on react and meteor.
Its basically a prototype for a vehicle licence application.

Users could login with their google account and apply for licence,
upload a copy of an application letter and a driving school certificate.
their geolocation is extrated from the address provided an stored in the database

A reviewer reviews the application and verifies that the uploaded docs are correct
and can accept or reject it an email is sent to the user

A processor could finally approve or reject the application and a SMS is sent to the user
